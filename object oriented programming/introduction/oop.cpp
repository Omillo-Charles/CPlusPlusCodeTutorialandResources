// OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming.
// Object-oriented programming is about creating "objects", which can hold data and functions that work on that data.
// classes and objects are the two main aspects of Object Oriented Programming.
// A class defines what and object should look like, and an object is created based that class.
// procedural programming is about writing functions that operate on data.
// object oriented programming is about creating objects that contain both the data and the functions.
